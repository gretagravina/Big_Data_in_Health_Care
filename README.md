# Big_Data_in_Health_Care
We're glad to share our Big Data in Healh Care project. We conducted an observational study on the survival of patients who have undergone implantation heart valves. You can access to the .rmd file to explore the code and download the html report. Both of them are avaiable in an italian version. You can also take a look ad the dataset we used and download it to improve our project!
